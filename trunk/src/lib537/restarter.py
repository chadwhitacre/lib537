"""Automatically restart your program when certain files change.

This module primarily solves the problem of refreshing modules in memory when
the source files change. There are two basic ways to solve this problem:

    1. Reload modules within a single process
    -----------------------------------------

    The basic trick is to delete items from sys.modules, forcing a refresh the
    next time they are loaded. This gets tough because imported modules depend
    on each other. Look at Zope and RollbackImporter for two implementations.


    2. Maintain two processes
    -------------------------

    In this solution, a parent process continuously restarts a child process.
    This gets around module import dependencies, but the downside is that you
    loose any program state on restart, and it magnifies the shutdown/start-up
    time of your program.


This module implements the second solution, automatically tracking source files
for all loaded modules, with the exception of those imported directly from a ZIP
archive (via zipimport). This module can also track non-source files, such as
configuration files. It provides the following members:

    CHILD, PARENT       These are booleans indicating whether the current
                        process is the parent or child.

    launch_child        Continuously relaunch the current program in a sub-
                        process until the exit code is something other than 75.

    should_restart      Return a boolean indicating whether the child process
                        should be restarted. If called in the parent process,
                        it always returns False.

    track(filepath)     Add <filepath> to the list of non-source files to track.
                        If the file is removed or has its modtime changed, the
                        program will restart.


Our implementation uses a thread in the child process (started when the module
is imported) to monitor all library source files as well as those added with
track. Your program is responsible for periodically calling should_restart,
exiting with code 75 whenever it returns True (presumably after cleanly shutting
down). Exit code 75 seems appropriate because of its meaning on Unix systems.
E.g., from FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE, /usr/include/sysexits.h:

    EX_TEMPFAIL -- temporary failure, indicating something that
    *              is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
    *              that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
    *              and the request should be reattempted later.
    [...]
    #define EX_TEMPFAIL     75      /* temp failure; user is invited to retry */

    -- /usr/include/sysexits.h, FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE


A modified file dependency is "not really an error," and the parent process is
"invited to retry" launching the child program.

Here's an example of what this looks like:

    import restarter
    import foo # your module; change to trigger reloading

    def main():
        # startup code here
        restarter.watch('foo.conf') # your conf file; change to trigger
                                    # reloading
        while 1:
            # program logic here
            if restarter.should_restart():
                # shutdown code here
                raise SystemExit(75)

    if restarter.PARENT:
        restarter.launch_child()
    else:
        main()


This module requires the subprocess module. Included in the standard library
since Python 2.4, it can also be found here:
