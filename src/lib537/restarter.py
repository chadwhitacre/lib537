"""Implement a module reloading mechanism.

This module solves the problem of refreshing Python modules in memory when the
source files change, without manually restarting the program. There are two
basic ways to solve this problem:

    1. Reload modules within a single process
    -----------------------------------------

    The basic trick is to delete items from sys.modules, forcing a refresh the
    next time they are loaded. This gets tough because imported modules depend
    on each other. Look at Zope and RollbackImporter for two implementations.


    2. Maintain two processes
    -------------------------

    In this solution, a parent process continuously restarts a child process.
    This gets around module import dependencies, but the downside is that you
    loose any program state on restart, and it magnifies the shutdown/start-up
    time of your program.


This module implements the second solution. It provides the following members:

    CHILD, PARENT       These are booleans indicating whether the current
                        process is the parent or child.

    launch_child        Continuously relaunch the current program in a sub-
                        process until the exit code is something other than 75.

    should_restart      Return a boolean indicating whether the child process
                        should be restarted. If called in the parent process,
                        it always returns False.


Our implementation uses a thread in the child process (started when the module
is imported) to monitor all library source files. Your program is responsible
for periodically calling mods_changed, exiting with code 75 whenever it returns
True (presumably after cleanly shutting down). Exit code 75 seemed appropriate
to use because of its meaning on Unix systems:

    EX_TEMPFAIL -- temporary failure, indicating something that
    *              is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
    *              that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
    *              and the request should be reattempted later.
    [...]
    #define EX_TEMPFAIL     75      /* temp failure; user is invited to retry */

    -- /usr/include/sysexits.h, FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE


Here's an example of what this looks like:

    import restarter

    def main():
        while 1:
            # program logic here
            if restarter.should_restart():
                # shutdown code here
                raise SystemExit(75)

    if restarter.PARENT:
        restarter.launch_child()
    else:
        main()


This module requires the subprocess module. Included in the standard library
since Python 2.4, it can also be found here:
